### Let's write some code!

Hi! I'm Anton, Python/Golang developer and SQLite enthusiast. I work on open source projects (see below), teach courses, and [blog](https://antonz.org/) about programming.

I've also written a book - **[SQL Window Functions Explained](https://antonz.org/sql-window-functions-book/)**. It's a clear and visual introduction to the subject, so check it out if you've ever struggled with SQL windows.

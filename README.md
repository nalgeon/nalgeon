### Let's write some code!

Hi, I'm Anton. Currently working on:

- [codapi](https://github.com/nalgeon/codapi) — Interactive code examples and sandbox.
- [redka](https://github.com/nalgeon/redka) — Redis re-implemented with SQL.
- [sqlean](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean) — SQLite extensions.

I've also written some [interactive books](https://antonz.org/#books) you might find useful.

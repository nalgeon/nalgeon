### Let's write some code!

Hi! I'm Anton, Golang developer and SQLite enthusiast. I work on open source projects (see below) and [blog](https://antonz.org/) about programming.

Currently working on:

- [redka](https://github.com/nalgeon/redka) — Redis re-implemented with SQLite.
- [codapi](https://github.com/nalgeon/codapi) — Interactive code examples for all types of technical writing.
- [sqlean](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean) — SQLite extensions.

I've also written some interactive books you might find useful:

[SQL Window Functions Explained](https://antonz.org/sql-window-functions-book/) •
[Curl by example](https://github.com/nalgeon/curl-by-example) •
[Git by example](https://github.com/nalgeon/git-by-example) •
[Grep by example](https://github.com/nalgeon/grep-by-example)

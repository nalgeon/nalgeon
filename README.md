### Let's write some code!

Hi! I'm Anton, Python/Golang developer and SQLite enthusiast. I work on open source projects (see below), teach courses, and [blog](https://antonz.org/) about programming.

I've also written a book - [SQL Window Functions Explained](https://antonz.org/sql-window-functions-book/) (about the subset of SQL that helps with data analysis). It's a clear and visual introduction to the subject, taking the reader step-by-step from the basics to advanced topics.
